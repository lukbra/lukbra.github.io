	I suck at C. It was not a big of a problem for most of my life but now I'm working in a project where not sucking at C is one of the desired qualities. I'm interacting with this language almost daily and one might think that it is ideal learning material. It is a good example of mature, complex project that is also unfortunately entangled in various external dependencies and this makes it tough to treat it as good learning resource for someone that starts from the bottom. To improve my situation, I tried Udemy courses and "let's make..." articles but nothing really clicked. Often I was finding myself debugging whatever the technological gap was between the tutorial and my environment. That was until I found that a lot of people learn languages with...</p>

	At first glance, it might look like it is a game engine. It is not, however, RayLib provides all means necessary to handle graphics, audio and interacting with your product but leaves blank canvas when it comes to tying it all together. Logic of even fundamental things like movement or object collision is yours to decide and this makes it a perfect environment for learning. Just be aware, that it comes with a cost of shifting your thinking about what a working program is to a different paradigm to use this goodness. At least I had to.<br>
	Fundamentally, game is executed in one huge while loop. Update the logic, draw a frame, update the logic, and draw the next frame. It took me a while to internalize this and I'm sure I will stumble many times, trying to debug values I am not expecting to appear. I think, in relation to what I'm doing at work it is also different enough, that despite using the same language, the distinction is clear, I don't think "work" when making anything with RayLib. Even this first project I undertook taught me a lot. One of the most valuable lessons I learned quickly was to...</p>

	RayLib site offers a wide range of usage examples and based on them, header definitions, and helpful Internet people, one is able to start making working prototypes of game elements quickly. It is  encouraging and works simply by copypasting the code to your IDE. With first fast wins I started to design my first "serious" game. It was a small 2D top down cRPG with fairly linear plot, 4 NPCs, simplified leveling system, quest system, dialog system, several maps... When I wrote down what do I actually need to implement in order to get all of this, it quickly became apparent that I went way too deep to produce anything of this caliber in foreseeable future. And most likely I didn't even know the half of what I really need to write. I set the project aside and started to think about something suitable for my level of expertise. No movement, simple controls, limited graphics... I came up with an idea of dueling game called...</p>

	Idea was simple, two cowboys are meeting to talk the differences under the scorching midday sun, to present their data-backed arguments and... Of course not! Whoever shots first, wins a round, whoever wins 3 rounds, wins the duel! I needed basic graphics and I'm not an artist by any means. I used the powers of AI and generated a background and few cowboy poses by putting my local machine to work. After heating up my room for an afternoon or two and quick Photoshop cleanup I had explicitly what I wanted. I turned out I explicitly wanted a cowboy and a cowgirl on a pixelart background of western town. It looked usable and somewhat within the same theme, good enough for me.<br>
	Then, code. Controls were simple, one keyboard button per player and few menu options to click around. Game state is where I had the most troubles, largely due to the gotchas of updating the loop logic. I solved the emerging problems as they were coming. For simplicity I focused on Windows compilation, again, enough for me to carry this to the finish line. For an extra credit in assignment no one will ever grade I thought I'll add Challenge Mode - where player will be able to write what is the duel for. Prize? Truth? Dare? You are the master of your fate now but be consise please, you have 50 chars or less to express it or else it won't fit in the game window. Still, given the extremely narrow scope of this game I'm about to give you, it was a lot of work and code lines count doesn't reflect it. I learned a lot and had fun doing it which I consider a mission success. Really imporatnt to me was that I was able to get back to working on it and now I can brag that I actually drove a side project to the end for once. Upon opening the code you mitght have an urge to write to me:</p>

	Sorry, I won't. If I am considering anything, it is that this game is a closed project. I myself see places to improve, to refactor, I would probably find many things to tweak, but at the end of the day, I'll be just reorganizing the same, badly designed bricks with less and less joy. It is better to say "good enough is good enough" for this one and transfer the learned lessons to the next thing.<br><br>

	My only wish is that I'll look at this in some time and I will have a good laugh.</p>
