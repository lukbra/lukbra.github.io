	I carry an ordinary D6 dice and I don't remember how it begun. When I need consulting in matters big (rarely) or small (often), this is my go-to.
	Dice toss in this context works just like a coin toss, but naturally because it has 6 sides instead of 2, it has more options. When I'm on the fence between two things, I tend to take odds and evens like heads or tails. Assigning uneven weights is also an option, for instance making 1-2 for heads 3-6 for tails, although I didn't find myself doing it yet. Eagle-eyed readers will notice that it works somewhat like this up to 6 options. Making decision by realizing that that particular choice is not what makes you happy is also available and even sometimes happens.<br>I tried to capture this approach in few simple rules, should you also want to use it:
	<br><br>
	1. <b>No dice is The Lucky Dice.</b> I can't stress this enough. As long as it is standardized unit, you are good to go. That’s also an argument against buying more pimped out dices made of metal or resin, or what have you. It’s easier to attach to them and this misses the point and brings us to conclusion that...<br><br>
	2. <b>... regular dice is good enough.</b> Of course, who am I to stop you from splurging on more fancy one but hear me out. Metal ones are impractical as they can scratch delicate surfaces or other items in your pocket and they are noticeably heavier. Handmade, resin dices are also expensive but most importantly look at p. 1. 	<br><br>
	3. <b>Sharing is caring.</b> If someone is in hard spot between matcha latte and tonic espresso, show them the way. On that note, when you will be buying your dice, grab a handful.<br><br>
	What I find using the dice interesting is that you decide that you will roll it and follow the outcome but in the same time the actual decision is made somewhat randomly. It is a peculiar spot between making your own decision but also the decision is in some sense made for you. Additionally, due to this blurred responsibility, there’s no one to blame if subjectively worse option was chosen. You just kind of roll with it (pun intended) and life is simpler with this stress offloaded to inanimate object. After all, it was your choice to leave your fate in… well your hand?</p>
