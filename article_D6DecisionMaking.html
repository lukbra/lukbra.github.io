		I carry an ordinary D6 dice and I don't remember how it begun. When I need consulting in matters big (rarely) or small (often), this is my go-to.<br>
	Dice toss in this context works just like a coin toss, but naturally because it has 6 sides instead of 2, it has more options. When I'm on the fence between two things, I tend to take odds and evens like heads or tails. You can also assign uneven weights, i.e. 1-2 for heads 3-6 for tails, although I didn't find myself doing it yet. Choosing between three and up is less flexible but it still requires only one toss instead of bisecting it, if you wish to use a regular coin. Eagle-eyed readers will notice that it works somewhat like this up to 6 options but it is also rare to have this many things to choose from and it also answers the question I heard few times: "why D6 and not D10 (D20, D100...)?".<br>I'm with this system for some time already, it helps me to offload burden of unimportant decisions, or throw in some randomness into my activities. Typical use cases are dishes or drinks, as well as what to do on a trip. I tried to capture this approach in few bullet points, should you also want to use it:

	1. <b>No dice is The Lucky Dice.</b> I can't stress this enough. As long as it is standardized unit, you are good to go. That’s also an argument against buying more pimped out dices made of metal or resin, or what have you. It’s easier to attach mystical value to them and this misses the point. It also brings us to the conclusion that...<br><br>
	2. <b>... regular dice is good enough.</b> In the end, who am I to stop you from splurging on more fancy one but hear me out. Metal ones are impractical as they can scratch delicate surfaces or other items in your pocket and they are noticeably heavier (I tried). Handmade, resin dices can be expensive but most importantly look at p. 1. Special dices tend to create special bond and we should avoid it.<br><br>
	3. <b>Sharing is caring.</b> If someone is in hard spot between matcha latte and tonic espresso, show them the way. On that note, when you will be buying your dice, grab a handful.<br><br>
	What I found using the dice interesting, is that you decide that you will roll it and follow the outcome but in the same time the actual decision is made somewhat randomly. It is a peculiar contract you agree to respect, unless you decide to do the exact opposite, which is also a valid option in D6 decision making. Importantly, there’s no one to blame if it will turn out that subjectively worse option was chosen. You just kind of roll with it (pun intended) and life is simpler with this stress offloaded to inanimate object. After all, it was your choice to leave your fate in… well, your hand.<br><br><br><br>
	<i>This is the first thing I wrote in a long time and it shows. This short text was sitting in my Obsidian Vault virtually for weeks. Sections were rewritten, rearranged and rephrased several times. As a result it is torn and pacing doesn't feel right to me but it is high time to say "it is good enough" and move on to the next things. Hopefully this will serve as comparison point for further improvements.</></p>
