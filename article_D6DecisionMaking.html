	I carry an ordinary D6 dice everywhere I go. When I need consulting in matters big (rarely) or small (often), this is my go-to. This offloads unnceccessary tension produced by having to make decisions through which I'm supposed to enjoy the moment, i.e. having a meal with my friends (but do I take ribs or cod?) or motorcycle ride (where should I go exactly?).<br> 
	Odds and evens can act as heads and tails. Expand on this and assign uneven weights, i.e. 1-2 for heads 3-6 for tails. Choosing between more than two (and less than seven) is easier, as it requires only one toss, however it is rare to have so many things to choose from. This observation also answers the question I heard few times: "why D6 and not D10 (D20, D100...)?". As ordinary as it seem to be, a lot of people did not realise how useful this can be, until they tried. I pride myself as diceism evangelist but truth to be told, up until this moment I did not dive any deeper into ritch waters Internet in search for meaning of what I do. This article, originally much more naive, is an attempt of fixing my mistake.</p>

	People were handing over their fate into hands of randomness for a long time. I believe that everything that applies to a coin has to apply to a dice and I'm treating both of them as equal random-based decision making tools.  Dig beyond entertainment and there's cultural and philosophical wealth of interesting material. For instance, the title of this article. It is a play on a concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipism">flipism</a>.

	So, you decide that you will roll but the decision is made randomly, this opens up three paths - you accept it, you do the opposite or you do not act. Just like flipism, you cannot blindly rely on that outcome but rather take it under the account. If you decide to roll with it, .</p>

	As closing words, I tried to capture this approach in few bullet points, should you want to use diceism yourself:  
	<br><br>
	1. <b>Blame the dice.</b> That's right, you offload that decision making with all the responsibility onto the inanimate object. Now you can enjoy the challenge that you have thrown your way.<br><br>
	3. <b>Regular dice is good enough.</b> It’s easier to attach mystical qualities to non-standard ones and if it happens, the dice becomes useless.<br><br>
	4. <b>Doing the opposite is fine.</b> Ever had that feeling that the result is not what you wanted? Sometimes the very act of knowing the decision will make you reconsider. The real art lays in recognizing these moments.<br><br>
	5. <b>Sharing is caring.</b> If someone is in hard spot between matcha latte and tonic espresso, show them the way. On that note, grab a handful when you will be buying the dice, it is easy to lose them.</p>
