		Born 1988, raised in Gdynia, Poland. I am a PhD Biologist with fair share of neurophysiological procedures on living (and surviving!) animals, laboratory classes and few EEG workshops. Nowadays, I work in back end validation and lately development, mostly around OS-level tools and platform drivers. I was involved in Optane Memory project, a validation paradigm shift-left change for server platform drivers and currently I'm starting my journey as memory reference code developer. In the meantime I got to know the inner workings of an internal startup. All four switches were within the same company and at this point I don't know if I am developing products, or do the products develop me. I guess either way is right. In the future I'd like to move towards Edge devices in biomedical-related fields, and dip my toes in technical writing.

		Memory reference code (MRC) features implementation work based on product specifications and official external standards (JEDEC). Responsible for weekly Memory Controller release. This description is live and will change over time. MRC is deep, deep waters and even getting a grasp will take considerable amount of time. As for the time of writing this ('24.WW28.07), the first sentence is a little bit optimistic but will eventually be true. My recent real-life tasks are grouping in three streams - a) porting over functionalities with C lang, RTL simulation and real pre-prod hardware b) enabling tests in CI - Jenkins, Groovy, Netbatch, Bash scripts and a pinch of Python c) weekly product releases with with occasional Verdi debug. I enjoy these tasks and plot twists they offer.<br><br>
		- Drove weekly Memory Controller releases ensuring latest fixes and features regularly reach the clients

		I was in two projects while being a validation engineer, actually. First was about the Optane Memory management validation, where I did more or less the same, but got more involved in managing people, assigning the tasks, keeping the defects and reports in check. By all accounts a step up in responsibilities. Then, when Optane Memory was sunset, we embarked on introducing shift-left validation for server drivers and I got sPCIe. It was a stack switch to C language. Project had a lot of greenfield patches in the landscape of automation, so also Python scripting. I was still responsible for preparing the test plans, test design and implementation based on specifications and requirements. Additionally we wanted to make our lives easier, less error-prone and more productive, so framework optimization and process automation went in. Also, throughout being val eng, I was responsible for tech-leading contractor workers at some point and introducing new team members to our project. I was about to start an improvement work group with fancy brainstorming whiteboards (people actually enjoyed it, believe it or not), when our validation activities were optimized or, how you would tell it in less corporate-oriented jargon, our positions were eliminated due to costs optimizations. Fair enough, the whole process wasn't maybe the most joyful thing I have experienced but I felt supported by my employer and people surrounding me.<br><br>
		- Drove automatic test cycle preparation which cut 2-3 h/wk. of manual work for 5/9 of teammates, this task completion made the whole process less prone to human error
		- Drove design and implementation of server PCIe test scope. Secured over 200 test cases and ~60% of test coverage before the job elimination
		- Led brainstorming meetings during which main pain points and their resolutions and task owners were identified. Ensured the whole team was engaged in analysis and decision making encouraging active discussion with the use of an interactive whiteboard
		- Increased contractor workers' self-reliance to the point of autonomous defect debugging, filing, and driving them to closure

		3-month-long venture during which conducted customer interviews, constructing small neural models using novel non-linear perceptrons and benchmarking them against the standard solutions. That was a wild ride but I learned a lot about myself, how big company works if it wants to be helpful, met interesting people and learned some things about making a product, as opposed to what most developers experience, which is writing some code. Unfortunately we didn't get get money, but we got a patent out of it, which is all I hoped for. <br><br>
		- Delivered product pitch for internal investors at Intel headquarters
		- Secured AI hardware patent for image compression and Multiplied and Accumulate unit using mentioned non-linear neurons

		I was hired in an interesting moment. The first actual Optane Memory hardware was about to arrive for testing. I took part in memory management tools validation but I got to be in the lab and work with the physical pre-production stuff, all good and bad things that came with it. Was responsible for configuring platforms, running regression tests, results reporting, and defect lifecycle. I usually got a question here: why did you change your job from University to IT? I felt like I needed a change, I hoped that one day experience I have collected during my PhD studies will help me. I'm finally making conscious moves into this direction. Results are yet to be seen, for now I have a plan and I started to follow it.<br><br>
		- Took part in reducing the test cycle from 2 weeks to 4 days through dynamic platform management and consistent test base code improvement.  Main test execution blockers were identified and addressed: test overlap was reduced, scope rearranged to optimize weekly platform usage, hardware environment was unified and made more redundant

		I was responsible for designing and conducting procedures on living laboratory rats - intracranial implantations of EEG recording electrodes and injection cannulas, rat conditioning, handling, signal recording and post processing - all these things were also part of my PhD studies. I applied for grants and received internal one for project named "Parabrachial nucleus and its potential influence on the regulation of theta rhythm in rats". Preliminary results indicated a trend but it was not continued. If you wish to continue that, remember that you are getting into angled implantation (a large blood vessel in the way) and it's far away from the bregma point. You'd need to start from a point much closer to the nuclei to mitigate at least some developmental differences between the animals. As part of my duties I also prepared laboratory space for student classes during the semester. I led neuroanatomy, anatomy and physiology lab classes during my studies and co-authored few publications.<br><br>
		- Secured internal research grant for Parabrachial nucleus and its potential influence on the regulation of theta rhythm in rats
		- Led neurophysiology, physiology, and anatomy laboratories
		- Led practical Electroencephalography (EEG) workshops for external listeners
		- Co-authored 3 major publications in the field of animal neurophysiology
