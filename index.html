        Welcome, dear Guest, my name is ≈Åukasz. Here you will find info about myself, my passions and interests. If you will find value in the articles, inspiration in my works or came here to check me out before job interview, it means that this site is doing a stellar job.<br> Not counting a HTML book I went through about 20 years ago (tables... tables everywhere), this is my first attempt in creating website. Tech stack in my footer reflects quite accurately my expertise but also how times changed.<br> 
		Anyways, I won't keep you here longer than needed, browse, enjoy, connect with me!</p>
